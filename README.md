# Random Message

### Purpose: 
*The purpose of this project is to display a random message every time the program is run. Since I had full creative freedom with this project, I opted to make the random message anime-themed. Specifically Naruto. So now any time that the program is run, it will give you a message stating how you completed the Hidden Leaf Ninja Academy. It also gives you five random stats, a designated clan, a skill average, and (based on your skill levels) a sensei to correspond with your ninja level.*

### Codecademy's Objective:
`For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.`
